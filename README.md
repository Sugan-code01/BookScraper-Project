#  BookScraper — Python Web Scraping Project using BeautifulSoup & SQLite

##  Project Overview
**BookScraper** is a Python-based web scraping project that extracts book details such as **Title**, **Price**, and **Availability** from a sample website using the **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** and **Requests** libraries.  
The extracted data is stored locally in an **SQLite database**, making it easy to query and analyze later.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Perform web scraping safely and efficiently
- Parse HTML pages using BeautifulSoup
- Store structured data using SQLite
- Build a foundation for data analysis or automation scripts
